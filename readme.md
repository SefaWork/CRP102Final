# CRP102 Final Project

This site is meant to replicate the design of https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/

The purpose of this project is a conceptual main page for a university's website. This website only includes one page and is fully static, meaning that it does not contain any Javascript and does not use any forms. This website was made for a final project with a group of 4 students and only serves as a demo/concept instead of being an actual product.

We called this university "XYZ University" since we could not decide on a name but it should not matter since not an actual product.
